# Optimisation SEO, debug et amÃ©lioration de l'accessibilitÃ© du site web de Nina Carducci

## You have never done code optimization for the PageSpeed scores?

I didn't either...  
This is my first [PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev) optimization.  
This project was also an introduction to web accessibility.  

Project made during an _OpenClassrooms_ bootcamp.
